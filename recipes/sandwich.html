        <h1>Freaking Banger BLT</h1>
        <br />
        <img src="photos/blt2.png" alt="a drawing of my blt">
        <p>I didn't have a photo on hand, so here's a drawing.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>I don't think you have any idea how awesome this BLT is.
            I forgot how I made it since it's been a while, but this guide
            should be pretty close.</h3>
        <p>It's your standard BLT, but it was freaking solid. Take the salty bacon,
            the crisp lettuce, the <em>tomatoes i guess</em>, with a mayo and dijon
            mustard blend, it's bound to make your significant other say,
            "Wow, you're cooking for once!"
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Notes before we start:</h3>
        <p>Realistically, BLTs are not made equal. A man's BLT may not be another
            man's BLT, and every single BLT is beautiful. I just happened to have these
            ingredients on hand and was able to make a concoction I had to come back to.
            <br />
            This being said, thick-cut bacon is gross and disgusting for this. I don't
            know why anyone would want this in their BLT. Texturally, it just doesn't work here.
            You can also play around with types of lettuce, but you'd want something with some
            crispness like romaine leaves. Lettuce is pretty tasteless, so making sure it adds something
            like texture is <em>crucial.</em>
